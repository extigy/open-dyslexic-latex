\begin{document}
Some text

 More text including off, office, affluent, fluorine, infinitude, --- and --

\slshape This is fake, oblique. The results will not be as good as a designed italic or oblique shape.

\upshape\scshape You may also get faked small-caps. Again, the results won't be as good as real small-caps.

\upshape\itshape This is italics text.

\textbf{This is bold text, \textit{and this is bolditalic text.}}
